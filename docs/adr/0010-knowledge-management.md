# ADR-0010: Repository knowledge: format, manifest generation, and agent-facing delivery

## Context

reinguard provides repo-owned semantic control for agentic development; its
internal Substrate runtime (`rgd`) stabilizes the information surface for
agents, humans, and the bots reviewing their work (ADR-0001). Repositories
declare **knowledge** under `.reinguard/knowledge/`—project-coupled guidance
that agents should read when acting in that repo.

Without normative rules:

- Metadata drifts between hand-edited indexes and manifests
- Agents receive only opaque paths with no triage signal
- Selection is either “all files” or ad hoc; there is no shared contract for narrowing knowledge by task

Alternatives considered:

| Dimension | Options |
|-----------|---------|
| Manifest SSOT | Hand-maintained `manifest.json` vs generated from knowledge files |
| Selection | Agent-only triage vs keyword filter in `rgd` vs signal-based automatic selection |
| Operational context | `paths[]` only vs rich `entries[]` with metadata |
| Agent bootstrap | `rgd` only vs per-platform bridge files (Cursor rules, `AGENTS.md`, etc.) |

## Decision

1. **Knowledge file format** — Knowledge entries are **Markdown** files under `.reinguard/knowledge/` with a **YAML front matter** block (delimited by `---`). Required front matter fields: `id` (unique string), `description` (one-line summary), `triggers` (non-empty list of keyword strings; no duplicates after trim, compared case-insensitively), and **`when`** (a match expression, same shape as control rules; ADR-0002). The body is free-form Markdown. Non-Markdown files are not indexed as knowledge entries.

2. **Manifest as generated artifact** — `manifest.json` is **not** hand-authored as the source of truth. **`rgd knowledge index`** scans knowledge Markdown files, reads front matter, and writes `manifest.json`. The manifest is **committed** so tools that do not invoke `rgd` (e.g. editor rules) can still read a stable catalog.

3. **Validation and freshness** — `rgd config validate` validates the manifest against its JSON Schema, checks that each `path` exists, statically validates each entry’s **`when`** (same rules as control rules: known `op` values and operands, registered `eval:` names, `eval: constant` params, and `path` prefixes `git.` / `github.` / `state.` / `gates.` / `$`), and **fails** if the manifest does not match a re-index from front matter (stale manifest). Optional **hints** (warnings) may flag oversized files or excessive trigger counts to support atomicity discipline without claiming semantic enforcement.

4. **Atomicity** — **Structural** guarantees: valid front matter, unique `id`, resolvable paths. **Semantic** “one concern per file” is a **review and authoring** discipline, not a machine guarantee.

5. **Operational context contract** — The `knowledge` object in operational context JSON carries **`entries`**: an array of objects including `id`, `path`, `when`, and typically `description` and `triggers`. The legacy `paths`-only shape is **removed** (see ADR-0008 synchronized versioning).

6. **Signal selection** — Every manifest entry carries **`when`**. **`rgd context build`** filters `knowledge.entries` with `match.Eval` against the merged flat map after adding runtime gate signals as **`gates.<id>.*`** and resolved **`state.*`** fields (ADR-0002, ADR-0014). Route and guard outcomes are not injected into that map for knowledge filtering (avoids circularity). **`rgd knowledge pack --observation-file`** is intentionally narrower: it flattens only the supplied observation document’s `signals` object and does not synthesize `gates.*` or `state.*` unless those keys are already present in that input.

7. **`rgd knowledge pack`** — Optional **`--observation-file`** applies the same `when` evaluation against the observation file’s nested **`signals`** only (not state-resolved and not gate-enriched by `rgd`). Optional **`--query`** matches **triggers** (case-insensitive substring). When **`--observation-file`** is set, results are the **OR union** (by entry id) of signal matches and query matches. When **`--observation-file`** is omitted, **all** entries are returned and **`--query`** filters by triggers only. Malformed `when` evaluation keeps the entry and emits diagnostics (**safe-side** for judgment aids).

8. **Agent consumption** — The **primary** platform-agnostic delivery is operational context JSON from **`rgd context build`**. **`rgd knowledge pack`** remains for catalog-style listing and optional observation + query composition. **Per-platform bootstrap** (e.g. Cursor `.cursor/rules/` pointing at `manifest.json`) is a **hybrid** concern: normative patterns may be documented here and exemplified in repositories; **`rgd init`-style scaffolding** may generate bridge files in a later change.

## Consequences

- **Clarification**: `when` is **required** in knowledge front matter and on every manifest entry (JSON Schema). Omission is an error at `rgd knowledge index` / parse time. Any earlier issue discussion that treated `when` as optional for knowledge entries is **withdrawn** and not authoritative relative to this ADR.
- **Easier**: Single SSOT for knowledge metadata (front matter); manifest drift is caught by `config validate`
- **Easier**: Agents can choose files using descriptions and triggers without opening every file first
- **Harder**: Authors must run `rgd knowledge index` after editing knowledge metadata and commit the updated manifest
- **Harder**: Breaking change for consumers of `knowledge.paths` only; they must migrate to `knowledge.entries`
- **Harder**: Authors must author meaningful `when` clauses; prefer signal-backed conditions (e.g. `op: exists` on `git.*` / `github.*`) so entries align with observation. `eval: constant` with `params.value: true` remains valid for rare always-on aids but is not signal-grounded
