# implement

## Context

- [`../policy/coding--preflight.md`](../policy/coding--preflight.md) — **Preflight verification** (HS-LOCAL-VERIFY, defensive checks, test design, self-review)
- [`../policy/coding--standards.md`](../policy/coding--standards.md) — **Change scope** (same-kind sweep across code, `.reinguard/`, `.cursor/`)
- [`../policy/commit--format.md`](../policy/commit--format.md) — branch naming
- [`../knowledge/testing--strategy.md`](../knowledge/testing--strategy.md) — GWT, table tests; also [`testing--assertions.md`](../knowledge/testing--assertions.md), [`testing--given-when-then.md`](../knowledge/testing--given-when-then.md)

**Already in context** (always-active Adapter rule): HS-* codes, catalogs, workflow & commit policy.

**Issue metadata** (from repo root):

```bash
gh issue view <N> --json title,body,labels,state
```

If no Issue number: list candidates and wait for approval:

```bash
gh issue list --state open --limit 30 --json number,title,labels
```

**Knowledge discovery** (substrate):

1. **Read the Issue** (`gh issue view …` above): pull **1–3 concrete search terms** from the **title and body** — subsystem or package names, ADR/issue refs, CLI subcommands, domain nouns, error messages, or phrases from **Touches** / **Definition of Done**. These are not generic words (“fix”, “bug”); use `description`, `triggers`, and required `when` in the manifest for human context when choosing terms.
1. **Run operational context** (default path — knowledge entries are signal-filtered after state merge):

```bash
rgd context build
```

Parse stdout JSON: use `knowledge.entries` for `id`, `path`, `description`, `triggers`, and `when`. Open each Markdown path (repo-relative) as needed.

1. **Optional keyword safety net** — if you need trigger substring matching **OR**-unioned with the same observation signals (see `docs/cli.md`): save observation JSON once, then run pack with `--query` (matches **triggers** only, case-insensitive substring):

```bash
rgd observe > /tmp/rgd-observe.json
rgd knowledge pack --observation-file /tmp/rgd-observe.json --query '<term derived from Issue title/body>'
```

Repeat with other salient terms if results are thin or off-topic.

**Observation** (when local GitHub signals help scope work):

```bash
rgd observe
```

## Act

1. Create feature branch per [`../policy/commit--format.md`](../policy/commit--format.md) § Branch naming: `<prefix>/<issue-number>-<short-description>` (type prefixes: `.reinguard/labels.yaml` `categories.type` with `commit_prefix: true`).
2. Search the codebase for existing paths, patterns, and dependencies; prioritize Issue **Touches** / **Go checks** sections.
3. **Doc impact**: list candidate updates (`docs/adr/`, `docs/cli.md`, `.reinguard/`). Carry this list forward to commit/PR; align finalized diffs before merge.
4. Implement per Issue **Definition of Done** and **Test plan** (the Issue Test plan states **intent**, not an exhaustive case-ID list — derive concrete Normal / Abnormal / Boundary cases from the diff; include tests in the same deliverable unless the Issue explicitly defers them).
5. Same-kind sweep per coding--standards § Change scope before hand-off.
6. **Preflight** per `coding--preflight.md` before commit/push.
7. **Commit organization**: review the commit history (`git log origin/main..HEAD`) and organize into logical, self-contained commits where needed (interactive rebase, amend, or squash). Each commit should represent one coherent change. This step is the primary location for commit restructuring — `change-inspect` may *recommend* restructuring but does not execute it.
8. When the branch passes local verification, commit organization is final, and the repository defines a runtime gate for it, record the result with `rgd gate record --status <pass|fail> <gate-id>` (for example `rgd gate record --status pass local-verification`) so future state rules can observe the verified handoff; artifacts live under `.reinguard/local/gates/` (ADR-0014). If Step 7 rewrites history afterward, re-run this step on the new HEAD.

## Output

- Issue: `#<N>` — title (and selection rationale if auto-listed)
- Scope recap: 1–3 bullets
- Files changed: paths
- DoD progress vs Issue checklist
- Doc impact list from step 3
- Preflight result (step 6 passed / exceptions documented)
- Commit status: organized / needs restructuring (step 7; carried forward to `change-inspect`)
- Runtime gate status (step 8 recorded / not applicable / deferred with reason)

## Guard

- All work traceable to an Issue (`Refs: #N` in commits per `commit--format.md`)
- **HS-LOCAL-VERIFY**, **HS-NO-SKIP** — enforced via `coding--preflight.md` (Act step 6)
- Prefer **`rgd`** for observation/context/knowledge; use **`gh`** / **`git`** for GitHub/git inspection per `evidence-temporary.mdc`
